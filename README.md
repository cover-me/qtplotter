# qtplotter

A data visualization notebook inspired by [Rubenknex/qtplot](https://github.com/Rubenknex/qtplot) and [gsteele13/spyview](https://github.com/gsteele13/spyview). Most of the code is grabbed from qtplot.

It's a simpler, easier-to-access version of qtplot for visualizing and interacting with our shared quantum transport data.

## Preview

## Run in the Cloud

The code can be run on mybinder.org so that the shared data, no matter local or online, can be visualized interactively with a few clicks.
